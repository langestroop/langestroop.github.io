Before joining the group, I completed my PhD with Prof Anil Seth, Dr Warrick Roseboom and Prof Luc Berthouze at the Sussex Centre for Consciousness Science.\nMy work lies at the intersection of human perception, memory and metacognition. Specifically, I am interested in the neural and computational mechanisms that underlie event segmentation, namely humans’ ability to segment the continuous flow of information reaching their senses into units of experience and how this ability influences memory and reality monitoring. To do so, I employ a combination of naturalistic experimental paradigms (e.g., videos, XR technologies), neuroimaging (e.g., M/EEG combined with eye tracking) and computational modelling.\n\n\n\nThis website is under construction, but feel free to reach out to me via my professional or personal email address and/or via any of the social media links reported above.

I first combined EEG and VR to investigate the electrophysiological correlates of altered body ownership induced by a visuomotor mismatch of a virtual limb with Prof Anil Seth and Dr Keisuke Suzuki. I subsequently employed EEG, ECG and psychophysics to study the relationship between Heartbeat Evoked Potentials and dissociation symptoms with Prof Hugo Critchley and Prof Sarah Garfinkel. I then deepened my knowledge in computational neuroscience applied to clinical settings by working under Prof Luc Berthouze on a project that aimed to assess the presence of long-range temporal correlations across different frequency bands in the EEG data of people with disorders of consciousness.\nBefore joining the University of Sussex, I completed an interdisciplinary MSc at the Berlin School of Mind and Brain - Humboldt Universität zu Berlin (MSc “Mind and Brain” - Track: Brain; Cognitive Neuroscience) where I was involved in three research projects. I first carried out an EEG study under Prof Dr Niko Busch and Dr Luca Iemi, to investigate the influence of spontaneous alpha oscillations in two visual detection and discrimination tasks. Subsequently, I joined the MindBrainBody Institute to work on a project with Prof Dr Arno Villringer and Dr Michael Gaebler involving the assessment of the recording quality of a portable dry EEG system (Open BCI). For my Master’s thesis within the group, I then combined the use of VR and EEG to investigate the link between participants’ alpha power fluctuations and their level of subjective emotional arousal during an immersive experience (roller coaster in VR) through a combination of machine learning and spatial filtering techniques (SPoC - Dähne et al., 2014). This work was then extended with two additional decoding and machine learning methods (CSP and LSTM) and it has recently been published on eLife.\nDespite the frequent travels, my research career began in Italy during my BSc in Science and Technology of Cognitive Psychology at the Univeristy of Trento. For my first internship, I worked on a computational model of visual perceptual learning with Prof Massimo Turatto. Consequently, I joined Prof. Liliana Albertazzi’s lab in a project investigating the influence of background on colour perception."
