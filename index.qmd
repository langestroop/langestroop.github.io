I an a Postdoctoral Research Fellow working at the [Episodic Memory Group](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/psychology/memory/index) with Prof [Chris Bird](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=smxv3nIAAAAJ&hl=en).

I completed my PhD within the [4-Year Sussex Neuroscience Programme](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/research/centres/sussex-neuroscience/phd/4yearphd) working at the [Sussex Centre for Consciousness](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/research/centres/sussex-centre-for-consciousness-science/) under the supervision of Prof [Anil Seth](https://www.anilseth.com/), Dr [Warrick Roseboom](https://www.warrickroseboom.com/home) and Prof [Luc Berthouze](https://berthouz.github.io/).

My work lies at the intersection of human perception, memory and metacognition. Specifically, I am interested in the neural and computational mechanisms that underlie event segmentation, namely humansâ€™ ability to segment the continuous flow of information reaching their senses into units of experience and how this ability influences memory and reality monitoring. To do so, I am mostly employing a combination of naturalistic experimental paradigms (e.g., videos, movies, XR technologies), neuroimaging (e.g., M/EEG combined with eye tracking) and computational modelling.
