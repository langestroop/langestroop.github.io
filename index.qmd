::: {#hero-heading}
I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow working at the University of Sussex (UK) in the [Episodic Memory Group](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/psychology/memory/index) with Prof [Chris Bird](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=smxv3nIAAAAJ&hl=en). Before joining the group, I completed my PhD with Prof [Anil Seth](https://www.anilseth.com/), Dr [Warrick Roseboom](https://www.warrickroseboom.com/home) and Prof [Luc Berthouze](https://berthouz.github.io/) at the [Sussex Centre for Consciousness Science](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/research/centres/sussex-centre-for-consciousness-science/).

My work lies at the intersection of human perception, memory and metacognition. Specifically, I am interested in the neural and computational mechanisms that underlie event segmentation, namely humans' ability to segment the continuous flow of information reaching their senses into units of experience and how this ability influences memory and reality monitoring. To do so, I employ a combination of naturalistic experimental paradigms (e.g., videos, XR technologies), neuroimaging (e.g., M/EEG combined with eye tracking) and computational modelling.
