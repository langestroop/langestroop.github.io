::: {#hero-heading}
I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow working at University College London (UCL) in the [OPM-M/EEG Group](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/team/meg-team/) with Prof [Gareth Barnes](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2WWDqYkAAAAJ&hl=en). Within the group, I am focusing on the development and use of Optically Pumped Magnometers (OPM) for naturalistic neuroscience experiments.
Before joining UCL, I did a Postdoc at the University of Sussex in the [Episodic Memory Group](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/research/centres/episodic-memory-group/index) of Prof [Chris Bird](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=smxv3nIAAAAJ&hl=en). Previously, I completed my PhD with Prof [Anil Seth](https://www.anilseth.com/), Dr [Warrick Roseboom](https://www.warrickroseboom.com/home) and Prof [Luc Berthouze](https://berthouz.github.io/) at the [Sussex Centre for Consciousness Science](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/research/centres/sussex-centre-for-consciousness-science/).

In general, my work lies at the intersection of human perception, memory and metacognition. Specifically, I am interested in the neural and computational mechanisms that underlie event segmentation, namely humans' ability to segment the continuous flow of information reaching their senses into units of experience and how this ability influences memory and reality monitoring. To do so, I employ a combination of naturalistic experimental paradigms (e.g., videos, XR technologies), neuroimaging (e.g., OPM, M/EEG combined with eye tracking) and computational modelling.
