:::{#hero-heading}

I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow working at the University of Sussex (UK) in the [Episodic Memory Group](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/psychology/memory/index) with Prof [Chris Bird](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=smxv3nIAAAAJ&hl=en).

My work lies at the intersection of human perception, memory and metacognition. Specifically, I am interested in the neural and computational mechanisms that underlie event segmentation, namely humansâ€™ ability to segment the continuous flow of information reaching their senses into units of experience and how this ability influences memory and reality monitoring. To do so, I am mostly employing a combination of naturalistic experimental paradigms (e.g., videos, movies, XR technologies), neuroimaging (e.g., M/EEG combined with eye tracking) and computational modelling.
