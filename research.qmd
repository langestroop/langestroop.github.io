My work lies at the intersection of human perception, memory and metacognition. Specifically, I am interested in the neural and computational mechanisms that underlie event segmentation, namely humansâ€™ ability to segment the continuous flow of information reaching their senses into units of experience and how this ability influences memory and reality monitoring. To do so, I am mostly employing a combination of naturalistic experimental paradigms (e.g., videos, movies, XR technologies), neuroimaging (e.g., M/EEG combined with eye tracking) and computational modelling.

Currently, I am specifically exploring the relation
